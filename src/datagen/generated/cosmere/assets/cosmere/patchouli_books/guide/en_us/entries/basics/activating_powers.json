This is not the most effective way of doing it, but it is straightforward.\nFirst, locate the icon for your current main power in the upper left corner. By pressing ($(k:key.cosmere.powers.next)$()) and ($(k:key.cosmere.powers.previous)$()) you can change which power is your current main. From there, press ($(k:key.cosmere.powers.mode.increase)$()) and ($(k:key.cosmere.powers.mode.decrease)$()) to change the mode for that power by plus or minus one respectively. If you are holding ($(k:Shift)$()) while you are changing the mode this way, it will change by plus or minus five levels, If instead you are holding ($(k:control)$()()) while you are changing the mode this way, it will change by plus or minus ten levels or to the maximum, whichever is lower.
