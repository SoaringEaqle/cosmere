Investiture permeates all matter and can function as a power source for several types of magics we call \"$(thing)Invested Arts$().\" You may already have access to one or more of these arts.",

      "text": "Once, all investiture belonged to one powerful being called \"$(thing)Adonalsium$(),\" but eventually 17 people decided to work together to kill him. They gathered four powerful artifacts made from investiture known as the \"$(thing)Dawnshards$()\" and killed him with them through means still unknown to us. After Adonalsium was killed, his investiture was broken into 16 Shards and each of the 17 people picked a shard and took it up, except for one, a man named \"$(thing)Hoid$().\" You may even see Hoid on your travels.",
